Research experience designing and implementing projects for biomedical data analysis (including next‑generation sequencing, RNA‑seq , and ssRNA‑seq ). I am interested in applying machine learning/deep learning tools and techniques in the context of disease diagnosis and large data analytics for public health while focusing on bridging the gap between computational and experimental laboratories through highly engaging and fruitful collaborations\n\nPython is my primary language for data analysis and machine learning.
