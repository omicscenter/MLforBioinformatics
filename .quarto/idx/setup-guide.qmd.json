This installation includes the `R` language and a graphical user interface (GUI). Rather using the GUI, we recommend installing `RStudio` - an integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you interact with `R` with some added benefits.\n\n## Installing `RStudio` \n\nTo install `RStudio`, visit <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. Once on the website, select `DOWNLOAD` tab (upper left corner), scroll down and click `Download` under the `RStudio Desktop` -- `Free` version (1st out of 4 columns), and select the proper installation file for your platform (Windows or Mac).\n\nWhen you open up `RStudio`, it should look like this:\n\n![](images/RStudio_console.png)\n\nClick the top left button to create a new script:\n\n![](images/New_script_click.png)\n\n`RStudio`, should now look like this:\n\n![](images/RStudio_4panes.png)\n\nThere are four main windows.\n\n-   The **console** is the lower-left window where you can run lines of code and see the output.\n\n-   The **script window** is the upper-left window where you can edit and write scripts or markdown documents. From the script window, you can run the current line of code in your script (or multiple lines if you highlight multiple rows) by pressing\n\n    -   `CMD` + `Return` on Mac\n    -   `CTRL` + `Enter` on Windows\n\n-   The **workspace** is the upper-right window where you can manage your data and variables and see previous commands entered (under the history tab).\n\n-   The **plots** window allows you to see the output of plots. On the other tabs, you can also look at directories, install packages, and look at help files for various `R` commands.\n\nYou can customize the look of your RStudio IDE in `Tools > Global Options...`.\n\n## `R` Packages \n\nPackages are the fundamental units of reproducible `R` code. They are collections of `R` code that typically share some common purpose. Examples:\n\n-   `dplyr` - package of functions for fast data set manipulation (subsetting, summarizing, rearranging, and joining together data sets);\n\n-   `ggplot2` - \"R's famous package for making beautiful graphics\"; allows to build multiple-layers, highly customizable plots.\n\n\n## Installing and Loading `R` Packages \n\n-   To install an `R` package, type in the `RStudio` console\n\n        install.packages(\"replace_with_package_name\")\n\n    and press enter to execute the command.\n\n-   Once a package is installed, to use its contents in current `R` session, we run in the `RStudio` console the command\n\n        library(replace_with_package_name)\n\n(Note the difference in presence of the quotation mark in the two above commands.)\n\n\n\n## Working with R -- RStudio\n\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R\n\n-   It helps the user effectively use R\n-   Makes things easier\n-   Is NOT a dropdown statistical tool (such as Stata)\n    -   See [Rcmdr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html) or [Radiant](http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/)\n-   All R Studio snapshots are taken from <http://ayeimanol-r.net/2013/04/21/289/>\n\n```{r, fig.alt=\"RStudio logo\", out.width = \"30%\", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bcc8535a06077094ca3c29c383e37ad7334311/a263f/assets/img/logo.svg\")\n```\n\n<sub>[[source](https://www.rstudio.com/)]</sub>\n\n## RStudio\n\nEasier working with R\n\n-   Syntax highlighting, code completion, and smart indentation\n-   Easily manage multiple working directories and projects\n\nMore information\n\n-   Workspace browser and data viewer\n-   Plot history, zooming, and flexible image and file export\n-   Integrated R help and documentation\n-   Searchable command history\n\n## RStudio\n\n```{r, fig.alt=\"RStudio\", out.width = \"80%\", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://ayeimanolr.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/r-rstudio-1-1.png?w=640&h=382\")\n```\n\n<!-- ## RStudio/R Console ![Console](images/r-rstudio-1-3-console.png) -->\n\n## Getting the editor\n\n```{r, out.width = \"90%\", echo = FALSE}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/both.png\")\n```\n\n## Working with R in R Studio - 2 major panes:\n\n1)  The **Source/Editor**: \"Analysis\" Script + Interactive Exploration\n    -   Static copy of what you did (reproducibility)\n    -   Top by default\n2)  The **R Console**: \"interprets\" whatever you type\n    -   Calculator\n    -   Try things out interactively, then add to your editor\n    -   Bottom by default\n\n## Source / Editor\n\n-   Where files open to\n-   Have R code and comments in them\n-   Can highlight and press (CMD+Enter (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows)) to run the code\n\nIn a .R file (we call a script), code is saved on your disk\n\n```{r, out.width = \"90%\", echo = FALSE}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/rstudio_script.png\")\n```\n\n<!-- ## Workspace/Environment ![Workspace](images/r-rstudio-1-ggplot-point-2.png) -->\n\n## R Console\n\n<!-- ![Console](images/rstudio_console.png) -->\n\n```{r, out.width = \"60%\", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/rstudio_console.png\")\n```\n\n-   Where code is executed (where things happen)\n-   You can type here for things interactively\n-   Code is **not saved** on your disk\n\n## RStudio\n\nSuper useful \"cheat sheet\": <https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf>\n\n```{r, fig.alt=\"RStudio\", out.width = \"65%\", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/rstudio_sheet.png\")\n```\n\n## RStudio layout\n\n```{r, fig.alt=\"RStudio layout\", out.width = \"100%\", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/first_markdown.png\")\n```\n\n## RStudio Layout\n\nIf RStudio doesn't look the way you want (or like our RStudio), then do:\n\nRStudio --\\> Preferences --\\> Pane Layout\n\n```{r, out.width = \"500px\", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/pane_layout.png\")\n```\n\n<!-- ## Source/Editor ![Script](images/r-rstudio-1-3-script.png) -->\n\n## Workspace/Environment\n\n<!-- ![Workspace](images/rstudio_environment.png) -->\n\n```{r, out.width = \"90%\", echo = FALSE}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/rstudio_environment.png\")\n```\n\n## Workspace/Environment\n\n-   Tells you what **objects** are in R\n-   What exists in memory/what is loaded?/what did I read in?\n\n**History**\n\n-   Shows previous commands.
