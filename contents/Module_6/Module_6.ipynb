    "Feature Selection is the process of choosing which features to use to answer your central question. Why would anyone want to limit the information availbale to them! Think Ockham's razor - when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. In short - \"the simplest explination is usually the best one\". This concept of fugality applied to describing nature is what we call parsimony. In practice, we aim to develop models with the least number of features.\n",

    "The advantages to this are that models train faster, are less prone to overfitting, and are usually more accurate. In this excercise we will apply various feature selection schemes to the Mobile Price Classification dataset distributed with this notebook to examine how it effects model performance."

Also, Notice there were some warnings raised by the table 1 when we first loaded the data. Addressing these errors could improve your final model's performance; remember garbage in garbage out. I'll leave that as an excercise to you."
