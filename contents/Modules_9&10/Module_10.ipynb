The paper demonstrated how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. The data was used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
